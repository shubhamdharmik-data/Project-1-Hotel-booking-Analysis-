🚀 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis | Data Analysis Project (Python, EDA, Visualization)

I’m happy to share my Hotel Booking Data Analysis project, where I analyzed real-world hotel booking data to understand why cancellations happen and how hotels can improve revenue and room utilization.

Along with the code, I also prepared a detailed PPT report that clearly explains the business problem, assumptions, research questions, hypotheses, analysis, and key findings—just like a real industry case study.

📌 Business Problem Addressed
City Hotels and Resort Hotels have been facing high cancellation rates, leading to revenue loss and unused rooms. The main goal of this analysis was to identify the key factors affecting cancellations and provide data-driven insights to support pricing and promotional decisions.

🔍 What I Did in This Project:

Cleaned and preprocessed hotel booking data (2015–2017)

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

Analyzed cancellation patterns by:

Hotel type (City vs Resort)

Average Daily Rate (ADR)

Month & seasonality

Booking source (Online TA, Offline TA, Groups, Direct)

Country-wise cancellations

Built clear visualizations and summarized insights in a PPT report

📊 Key Insights:

Around 37% of bookings were canceled, significantly impacting revenue

Higher prices lead to higher cancellation rates

City Hotels receive more bookings than Resort Hotels

August has the highest number of bookings, while January shows high cancellations

Most bookings come from Online Travel Agencies (~46%)

Portugal recorded the highest number of canceled reservations

🧠 What I Learned:
This project strengthened my ability to:

Think in terms of business problems

Convert raw data into actionable insights

Present findings clearly through visuals and presentations

Work like a real Data Analyst / Data Scientist
